This is a cabin reservation system we built with my school mates. It works locally on a computer and it utilizes an sql database for the reservations.

KuhaParki was mainly responsible for the UI and funcionality of the software.
Wikuli did a lot with the backend and also functionality.
Jorkula and StranTXd did a bit of everything.
